# Overview

This checkers project helped me to become more familiar with Java and creating programs in IntelliJ. Previously, I had worked with Java to create a PDF converter
in Android Studio, but this project helped me to further my understanding of Java.

The software that I wrote is a checkers game that can be played by two people. Two people decide between red and black pieces, and they play to see who still has checker
pieces left on the board.

The reason that i decided to create this type of software was because I wanted to created a program that used several different functionalities of Java. Making a checkers
game gave me the opportunity to see how different classes are used to create runnable programs.

Below is a video demonstration of the software that I created.

# Development Environment

This program used IntelliJ as its development environment. I decided to use IntelliJ because I have not used its development environment before, and I wanted to become more 
familiar with how to use it.

The programming language that I used was Java. To get my checkers game to work, I used the JavaFX library. JavaFX provided many useful tools to help create the checker pieces
and the board. My program consists of some classes and enums.

# Future Work

* I need to add player constraints to the game. At the moment, players can move as many times as they want. This needs to be fixed so that the game can be played fairly.
* I need to add the ability to king. This is important because at the moment, pieces can move to the opposite end, but they are not able to move forward and backwards once they
are in that position.
* I need to add the ability to reset the board. At the moment a player has to exit out and restart the application before they can play the game again.
